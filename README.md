Voltcore is an experimental project focused on the development of an inertial impulse-based energy and light generator that functions without traditional fuel sources. It uses controlled internal mass interactions and microcontroller logic to produce directional impulses and convert kinetic energy into light or electromagnetic pulses.

## Key Features

- Inertial propulsion without reaction mass
- Light or electromagnetic pulse generation
- Based on ESP32 microcontroller
- Open research for experimental physics and future technologies

## Status

The project is in prototype development. Components are selected, and small-scale assembly is in progress. We are currently testing basic motion and resonance effects.
